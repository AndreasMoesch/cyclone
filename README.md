## CHANGELOG from Codepen

- Changed data entries to be saved under user (first part of email address).
- Making Project "break" adding automatically "private" entries.
- Fixed: Summary stats which broke because of user change

TODO for next version:
 * check script version which we are loading now.
 * fix issues if manual entry is the first one (and there are others)
 * clone entry?
 * stats (daily, weekly, monthly?)
 * show old entries
